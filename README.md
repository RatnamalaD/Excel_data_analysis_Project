## Manufacturing Sales and Profitability Dashboard
### Overview:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of a manufacturing company’s product‑level sales performance and profitability. The dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of overall revenue performance and profitability across products, segments, and countries.

### It brings together essential financial KPIs—
**Total Revenue trend over time**, **Gross Profit, Gross Profit Margin, and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**— to help stakeholders understand how sales activities translate into profit.

The analysis begins by tracking Gross Revenue, Net Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Profit Margin to evaluate top‑line performance and product‑level profitability. By incorporating Manufacturing Cost and COGS, the dashboard highlights how production expenses impact margins and identifies cost‑intensive products that reduce overall profitability.

Interactive visuals allow users to compare sales volume, revenue contribution, and profitability across product categories, regions, and time periods. **Trend charts reveal seasonality and demand patterns**, **while product‑level breakdowns help pinpoint high‑margin vs. low‑margin items**. **A dedicated profitability section illustrates how discounts and manufacturing costs affect revenue and gross profit**.

Users can filter results by country, segment, product, discount band, and month, enabling detailed analysis across multiple business dimensions. Visuals highlight revenue trends, profitability patterns, product‑level performance, and regional contribution, making it easy to identify growth drivers and areas needing attention.

### This dashboard supports strategic decision‑making by enabling stakeholders to:
- Identify top‑performing and underperforming products
- Analyze the relationship between manufacturing cost and gross profit
- Monitor revenue and margin trends over time
- Evaluate pricing effectiveness and cost efficiency
- Prioritize products that maximize profitability
