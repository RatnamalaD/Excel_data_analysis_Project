## Manufacturing Sales and Profitability Dashboard
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of a manufacturing company’s product‑level sales performance and profitability. The dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of overall revenue performance and profitability across products, segments and country. It brings together essential financial KPIs—Total Revenue trend over time, Gross Profit, Gross Profit Margin, and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)—to help stakeholders understand how sales activities translate into profit.

Users can filter results by country, segment, product, discount band, and month, enabling detailed analysis across multiple business dimensions. Visuals highlight revenue trends, profitability patterns, product‑level performance, and regional contribution, making it easy to identify growth drivers and areas needing attention.
